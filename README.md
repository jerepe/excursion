# Excursion Website-Project from the CodeCademy - Git & GitHub course

Project done using only the Command Line interface and Emacs.

## Why using Emacs ?

When doing the Holberton School entrance tests we were advised to use Emacs, which is the only text editor i know with Nano.
Therefore i chose to use it again to develop good skills in order to be ready when i need a text editor.

## Why using the CLI ?

Workflow speed can be drastically increased when having good CLI skills. 
It's one of the basics of Computer Science, good hackers need to use and master it. I am interested in Cybersecurity, therefore it became a point of interest. 
I then develop a strong attraction to its application skills, and really enjoy it.
Which brought me to use it in order to further my skills

## Did i need to install extra softwares in order to achieve this project ?

Yes. I am a Mac Os user which brought me to install Brew so i could install and use Emacs.
